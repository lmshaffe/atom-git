# language-pug-jade

[Pug](https://github.com/pugjs) _and_ **Jade** syntax highlighting for Atom, because name changes are confusing. Adapted from [atom-jade](https://github.com/devongovett/atom-jade) by [devongovett](https://github.com/devongovett).

This was originally just for my personal use since the [language-pug](https://github.com/genoma/language-pug) package by [genoma](https://github.com/genoma) has some highlighting issues. I don't plan on updating this, but will merge any _(decent)_ PRs that come through 👍

This _should_ support both Pug and Jade highlighting, but I have no idea what I'm doing 🤷
