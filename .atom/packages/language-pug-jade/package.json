Adapted from [atom-jade](https://github.com/devongovett/atom-jade) by [devongovett](https://github.com/devongovett).\n\nThis was originally just for my personal use since the [language-pug](https://github.com/genoma/language-pug) package by [genoma](https://github.com/genoma) has some highlighting issues. I don't plan on updating this, but will merge any _(decent)_ PRs that come through üëç\n\nThis _should_ support both Pug and Jade highlighting, but I have no idea what I'm doing ü§∑\n",
